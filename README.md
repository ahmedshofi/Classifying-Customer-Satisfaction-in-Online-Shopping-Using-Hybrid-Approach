# Predicting-Customer-Satisfaction-in-Online-Shopping-Using-Hybrid-Approach
This work focuses on predicting customer satisfaction on online shopping platforms by leveraging machine learning algorithms. A comprehensive dataset was
constructed, incorporating product reviews, helpful votes, delivery information,
and ratings. The dataset was carefully filtered to include reviews containing categorical data related to quality, service, and price, and manual extraction was
performed to ensure data accuracy. Sentiment analysis was then employed to
determine the overall sentiment score of product reviews, categorizing them into
two classes: positive and negative. Different machine learning classification models, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting,
were applied to evaluate their predictive performance. In addition to sentiment
scores, the dataset was enriched with features like helpful votes, quality, service,
price, and delivery. A multiclass classification approach was utilized to categorize
user satisfaction levels into three classes: not satisfied, moderate satisfied, and
satisfied. The research aims to provide valuable insights into customer satisfaction, allowing businesses to make informed decisions and optimize strategies for
improved user experiences. The outcomes of this study can contribute to enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty, providing a competitive advantage for
businesses operating in the dynamic e-commerce landscape.
